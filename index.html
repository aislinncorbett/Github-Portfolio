			<h3>Project 2</h3>
		</header>

		<p>In our group project on supervised learning, we leveraged supervised machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, 
			to enhance demand forecasting in the retail sector. Our comprehensive study involved data cleaning, feature engineering, 
			and the application of Random Forest models to predict and analyse retail demand. We focused on preparing 
			the data through various cleaning methods and engineering features that help identify trends and seasonal patterns. 
			By utilising Python, particularly libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, we improved the accuracy of our forecasts 
			and presented our findings through interactive visualisations. This project not only strengthened our analytical and programming skills 
			but also deepened our understanding of machine learning's impact on real-world business challenges.

			<h3>Project 3</h3>
		</header>

		<p>For this Power BI project, I developed a comprehensive dashboard to visualise sales data effectively. 
			The project involved importing and modelling large datasets using Power BI’s data transformation capabilities. 
			I created interactive reports that provide analysis on various elements, such as time periods, product categories, and geographic regions. 
			This experience honed my skills in data visualisation, report design, and advanced analytical techniques, ensuring the dashboard was 
			both user-friendly and rich with actionable insights. I enjoyed completing this dashboard as it was the first time I 
			independently used Power Bi and it thought me all of the necessary applications that helped me in future projects using the programming platforms.

		<p>The analysis of employment patterns in different industries and geographical areas is the main goal of this Power BI project. 
			The project uses a variety of data sources, such as industry reports and government labour statistics, 
			all of which go through a rigorous cleaning process to guarantee accuracy and consistency. The report features several key visualisations, 
			such as line graphs for trend analyses across time, maps showing the regional distribution of occupations, and bar and pie charts 
			for industry comparison comparisons. Further demographic breakdowns provide light on discrepancies in employment. Important conclusions 
			are presented in the presentation, including the identification of high-growth industries and areas with plenty of job prospects. 
			Users may personalize views by filtering data across several parameters using interactive capabilities in Power BI reports, 
			which improves user experience and makes the findings more relevant.

			<h3>Project 5</h3>
		</header>

		<p>To clean this data set and create visualisations for it, I analysed the data to create as many variables as possible 
			of visualisations that I could. These included bar charts that compare average costs by car make and year, scatter plots that examine 
			the link between miles and price, and histograms that show price distributions. To further improve the study, it also contains the 
			interquartile range approach for outlier reduction. In order to analyse links between numerical data and provide a thorough 
			understanding of how various elements, such as car age and mileage, affect automobile pricing, a correlation heatmap is finally 
			constructed. This script provides a better insight of auto pricing patterns by combining meticulous data preparation with sophisticated visual analysis.

		<p>When I am learning new skills, I prefer the method of using visual aids, in order to ensure I fully can understand and comprehend the information being relayed. 
			Videos and video tutorials provide both aural and visual learning experiences, and they are especially helpful for learning statistical analysis techniques 
			or complicated analytical ideas that need step-by-step processes, such as software tutorials. I utilised platforms such as 
			Kubicle, YouTube tutorials and Tableau to help me learn new skills and expand on my previous knowledge. Visual tutorials are very helpful for learning analytical tools and applications 
			like as SQL, R, Python, and Power BI since they let me view and apply what I’ve learning in real-time at the same time

		<p>In today's commercial world, business analytics is essential for turning unstructured data into meaningful insights. 
			It facilitates pre-emptive decision-making by not only analysing historical data but also forecasting future patterns. 
			Predictive analytics, for instance, anticipates market trends and consumer behaviour, which helps businesses optimise their business plans. 
			In my experience, making use of these insights has been crucial for seeing possibilities and minimising risks in advance. 
			Additionally, programs like Python and Power BI have simplified data and opened up analytics to all organisational levels. 
			Looking ahead, I believe corporate analytics will likely become more deeply integrated with AI and machine learning, 
			improving the accuracy of forecasts, and fostering innovative operations. As someone interested in the potential of technology, I'm excited about these advancements 
			and the new challenges they will bring to the field of business analytics.

			<h2>In Class Application</h2>
		</header>

		<header>
			<h3>Python Exam</h3>
		</header>
		<p>In semester one, I completed an in-class Python exam that tested my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. The exam focused on tasks like creating and sorting NumPy arrays, 
			converting data into Pandas Data Frames, and manipulating dictionaries and lists for data retrieval and organisation. In order to prepare, I went over the course materials in great detail. 
			I also participated in group study sessions and actual coding activities, all of which helped me solidify my knowledge of Python's libraries and data structures. 
			I enjoyed questions that involved uploading data to Python from my documents and manipulating the data and implementing it into visuals. I liked these questions as it covered many different aspects of data manipulation 
			and allowed me to portray my learned skills. The exam was tough and on my first attempt it did not go well for me, and I completed a retest. I was much better prepared for my retest and received 84% in the second exam.
			</p>
			
			<header>
				<h3>SQL Exam</h3>
			</header>
			<p>SQL is a standard programming language specifically designed to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is key to business analytics, and we completed many lectures on it, 
				after we completed an in class exam on the topic. In the exam, I addressed basic ideas like records, foreign keys, and database normalisation phases and I stressed the need of implementing CRUD operations and comprehending the links between tables. 
				I had to construct tables, enter data, and carry out tasks like figuring out average wages. Here, maintaining syntax accuracy and successfully executing intricate SQL instructions were challenges. I found this SQL exam tough, 
				and it highlighted my strengths, such as basic operations and simple queries, but also pinpointed areas needing improvement, particularly in advanced data manipulation and joins. </p>

			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		</header>
		<p>I stay busy with a wide variety of activities. I love sports, especially rugby and GAA, and I play and watch them with great enthusiasm. These sports foster my passion of competition and collaboration while also introducing me to a dynamic community of like-minded individuals. 
			I also like to go hiking since it's a great way for me to discover the outdoors and relax from the daily grind. I enjoy baking a lot when I'm at home. In addition to providing a creative outlet, this activity allows you to share something unique with your loved ones. 
			Every one of these pursuits makes my life happier and more fulfilling, improving both my physical and mental health. </p>
			
			<header>
				<h3>Volunteer work</h3>
			</header>
			<p>I have volunteered for more than ten years with two significant organisations, which improved my knowledge of community service and gave me the opportunity to make a constructive contribution to society. I participated in the Operation Christmas Shoebox Appeal, 
				a program that fills shoeboxes with gifts to distribute to underprivileged children worldwide throughout the holiday season. This was a really fulfilling experience since we gave children in need a practical method to make the holidays happier. 
				I also did voluntary work with KARE, a group that advocates inclusion for those with intellectual impairments. I aided KARE in a number of projects aimed at improving the lives and community inclusion of people with intellectual impairments. Both of my volunteer experiences were incredibly rewarding; 
				they strengthened my resolve to support charities and expanded my understanding of the value of generosity and community. </p>
